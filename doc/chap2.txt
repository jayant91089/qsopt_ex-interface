  to install the package:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YTo  get  the  newest version of [23X\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}[123X,
        download           the           .zip           archive           from
        [7Xhttps://github.com/jayant91089/qsopt_ex-interface[107X  and unpack it using
        [23X\texttt{unzip  qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface-x.zip}[123X in the terminal. Do
        this   preferably   inside   the   [23Xpkg[123X  subdirectory  of  your  GAP  4
        installation.      It      creates      a      subdirectory     called
        [23X\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}[123X.   If   you   do  not  know  the
        whereabouts of the [23Xpkg[123X subdirectory, invoke the following in GAP:[133X

        and  run the install script [23X\texttt{unix-install.sh}[123X from the terminal
        as  [23X\texttt{sh unix-install.sh}[123X. This locally installs qsopt exact and
        its  dependencies  (GMP  [Gt15],libz  and  libbz2)  in lib and include
        folders.  Alternatively,  if  you  have  qsopt-exact  and  GMP already
        installed   on   your   system,  you  can  edit  the  Makefile  inside
        [23X\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}[123X  directory so that gcc finds the
        .so  libraries.  In latter case, you must manually '\texttt{make all}'
        from   the   terminal   inside   [23X\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}[123X

        interface.  Note  that  before using the package in GAP, one must edit
        either              the              environment              variable

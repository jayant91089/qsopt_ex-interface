<Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> is a GAP package that provides an interface to <Math>QSopt</Math> exact rational
linear program solver <Cite Key="qs"/> by Applegate,Cook,Dash and Espinoza. This is a minimalist package exposing parts of qsopt to GAP. The particular version of QSopt-exact
solver this package currently follows is 2.5.10-patch 3 of a fork of the original software maintained by Jon Lund Steffenson <Cite Key="qsjon"/>, which removes certain dependencies and
makes the software easier to build. <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> provides a C wrapper qsinterface.c to the solver. It is currently available for Unix/Linux systems running GAP <Math>4.5+</Math>.

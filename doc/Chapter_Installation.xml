Assuming you already have GAP 4.5+ installed, you can follow the steps below to install the package:
<List>
<Item>
To get the newest version of <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math>, download the .zip archive from <URL>https://github.com/jayant91089/qsopt_ex-interface</URL>
and unpack it using <Math>\texttt{unzip qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface-x.zip}</Math> in the terminal.
Do this preferably inside the <Math>pkg</Math> subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math>.
If you do not know the whereabouts of the <Math>pkg</Math> subdirectory, invoke the following in GAP:

GAPInfo.("RootPaths");

Look for pkg directory inside any of the paths returned.

<Item>
Once unpacked, go to <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> directory and
run the install script <Math>\texttt{unix-install.sh}</Math> from the terminal as <Math>\texttt{sh unix-install.sh}</Math>.
This locally installs qsopt exact and its dependencies (GMP <Cite Key="Granlund12"/>,libz and libbz2) in lib and include folders. Alternatively,
if you have qsopt-exact and GMP already installed on your system, you can edit the Makefile inside <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> directory
so that gcc finds the .so libraries. In latter case, you must manually '\texttt{make all}' from the terminal inside <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> directory.
</Item>
<Item>
Above step creates an executable \texttt{qsi} inside the <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> directory, which serves as the interface. Note that
before using the package in GAP, one must edit either the environment variable <Math>\texttt{LD}\_\texttt{LIBRARY}\_\texttt{PATH}</Math> or the
so that \texttt{qsi} finds the locally installed libraries.

One can now start using <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> by invoking
